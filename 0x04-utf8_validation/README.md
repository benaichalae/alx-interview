# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation

This project focuses on validating whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. To successfully complete this project, you will need to apply your knowledge in bitwise operations, understand the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and utilize your Python programming skills.

## Concepts Needed

### Bitwise Operations in Python

You will need to manipulate bits in Python using operations such as AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), and shifts (<<, >>). Refer to the [Python Bitwise Operators](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bitwise-operations-on-integer-types) documentation for more information.

### UTF-8 Encoding Scheme

Familiarize yourself with the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes. Understand the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character. The following resources will be helpful:

- [UTF-8 Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
- [Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html)
- [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html)

### Data Representation

Learn how to represent and work with data at the byte level. You will need to handle the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.

### List Manipulation in Python

Be comfortable iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions. Refer to the [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists) documentation for more information.

### Boolean Logic

Apply logical operations to make decisions within your program.

By studying these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you will be equipped to tackle the UTF-8 validation project. Apply bitwise operations and logical reasoning to determine the validity of UTF-8 encoded data.

Good luck!
