The "0x05. N queens" Project
The N queens problem is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. In this project, you will learn how to implement an efficient solution to the N queens problem using Python.

Concepts Needed
To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand the following concepts:

Backtracking Algorithms
Backtracking algorithms are used to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed. By using backtracking, you can efficiently search through all possible solutions to a problem and find the correct one.

Backtracking Introduction
Recursion
Recursive functions are essential for implementing backtracking algorithms. By using recursion, you can break down a problem into smaller sub-problems and solve each one independently.

Recursion in Python
List Manipulations in Python
Lists are a powerful data structure in Python, and they are especially useful for storing the positions of queens on the board. By understanding how to manipulate lists, you can efficiently store and retrieve information about the state of the board.
